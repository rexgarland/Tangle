# rexgarland/Tangle

This is a fork of [Tangle](https://github.com/worrydream/Tangle).

The main addition here is a tool to compile your tangle doc into a standalone `.html` file you can share with others.

## Installation

```shell
npm install
```

## Running

Edit the files `example.*` in the `src` directory, then run
```shell
npm run export
```

Everything will be packaged into `dist/document.html`. You can share it with your grandma!

## Other additions

* added TKLogAdjustableNumber class
* number format tweak
